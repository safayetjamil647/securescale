# Nginx Curated Images

Hardened Nginx images based on **Chainguard Distroless**. These images are designed to serve static content or act as a reverse proxy with a minimal attack surface.

## Images

| Variant | Tag | Base | Size |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Mainline** | `securescale/nginx:1.25-distroless` | Chainguard | ~15MB |
| **Stable** | `securescale/nginx:1.24-distroless` | Chainguard | ~14MB |

## Usage Example

Serving a static website:

```dockerfile
# Build Stage
FROM node:20-alpine AS build
WORKDIR /app
COPY . .
RUN npm install && npm run build

# Production Stage
FROM securescale/nginx:1.25-distroless
COPY --from=build /app/dist /usr/share/nginx/html
# No extra configuration needed for basic static serving
```

## Security Features

1. **Zero CVEs**: Scanned daily and rebuilt on every security patch.
2. **Minimalist**: Contains only the Nginx binary and required libraries—no shell or unnecessary utilities.
3. **Non-root**: Configured to run as a non-privileged user by default.
4. **Optimized**: Fast startup times and extremely small footprint.
