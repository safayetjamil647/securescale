# Hardening Best Practices

Follow these steps to ensure your containerized applications are as secure as possible.

<Steps>
### Use Curated Base Images
Avoid standard library images like `python`, `node`, or `ubuntu`. Use `securescale` images or distroless bases to minimize the attack surface.

### Run as Non-Root
Never run your application as root. All SecureScale images come with a `nonroot` user.
<Callout type="info">
  The `nonroot` user in Wolfi-based images typically has UID `65532`.
</Callout>

### Multi-Stage Builds
Build your application in one stage and copy ONLY the necessary binaries to the final stage.

### Read-Only Filesystem
Run your containers with `--read-only` to prevent attackers from writing to the disk.
</Steps>

## CVE Checklist

| Action | Tool | Benefit |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Scan Daily | Trivy / Grype | Identify new vulnerabilities early. |
| Monitor SBOMs | Syft | Track all dependencies (even transitive). |
| Sign Images | Cosign | Verify the image hasn't been tampered with. |

> [!WARNING]
> While curated images reduce risk, the code YOU write is still your responsibility. Always perform static analysis (SAST) on your own code.
