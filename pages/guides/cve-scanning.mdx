# CVE Scanning

Integrating vulnerability scanning into your CI/CD pipeline is critical for maintaining a secure posture.

## Recommended Tools

### 1. Trivy (by Aqua Security)
The industry standard for container scanning.

```bash
trivy image securescale/python:fastapi-3.11
```

### 2. Grype (by Anchore)
Fast and lightweight, great for CI pipelines.

```bash
grype securescale/nodejs:20-distroless
```

## GitHub Actions Integration

Add this snippet to your `.github/workflows/scan.yml`:

```yaml
steps:
  - name: Run Trivy vulnerability scanner
    uses: aquasecurity/trivy-action@master
    with:
      image-ref: 'your-image-tag'
      format: 'table'
      exit-code: '1'
      ignore-unfixed: true
      vuln-type: 'os,library'
      severity: 'CRITICAL,HIGH'
```

## SBOM (Software Bill of Materials)

SecureScale images include high-quality SBOMs. You can extract them using `syft`:

```bash
syft securescale/python:fastapi-3.11 -o cyclonedx-json > sbom.json
```
