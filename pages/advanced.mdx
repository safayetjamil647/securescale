# Getting Started

Start using SecureScale curated images in your development and production environments.

## 1. Choose your image
Browse the [Curated Images](/images) gallery to find the base that matches your framework (FastAPI, Django, Express, etc.).

## 2. Update your Dockerfile
Switch your existing base image to a SecureScale hardened base.

```dockerfile
# BEFORE
# FROM python:3.11-slim

# AFTER
FROM securescale/python:fastapi-3.11
```

## 3. Configure Runtime Security
To get the full benefit of SecureScale, run your containers with read-only filesystems.

```bash
docker run --read-only securescale/python:fastapi-3.11
```
